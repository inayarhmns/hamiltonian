### Algorithm
Hamiltonian Path with dynamic programming algorithm is in `hamiltonian_path.py`. Hamiltonian Cycle with backtracking algorithm is in `hamiltonian_path.py`

### Dataset
All of the datasets are generated by code in `dataset_generator.py`. It generates the datasets in `/dataset`.

### Testing
Testing the algorithm is done in `/test` where:
- `test_hamiltonian_cycle.py` : tests all of the datasets on Hamiltonian cycle algorithm and store the results in `/test/result/hamiltonian_cycle_result.txt`.
- `test_hamiltonian_path.py` : tests all of the datasets on Hamiltonian path algorithm and store the results in `/test/result/hamiltonian_path_result.txt`.
- `result_graph.py` : Visualize the graph based on the existing result.
